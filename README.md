- 👋 Hi, I’m @lsmohan
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning in conjunction with physics based models (sciml, PINN etc.)
- 🌱 I’m currently working with the Julia and SciML framework, along with Bayesian Statistics. I am very proficient in Python, and the ML ecosystem.
- 💞️ I’m also interested in computational thinking especially as applied to engineering education.
